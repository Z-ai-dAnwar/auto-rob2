# Architecture

This document explains how `auto-rob2` works internally and where to look when
changing or debugging it. For installation and command-line usage, start with
`README.md`.

## Design Goals

`auto-rob2` is built around four constraints:

1. **The primary paper stays central.** Supplements and registries enrich the
   evidence base, but they do not replace the study report.
2. **Context is selected before prompting.** Long PDFs and supplements are
   parsed into chunks, retrieved, and packaged so domain prompts receive
   targeted evidence rather than whole documents.
3. **LLMs do not make final labels directly.** LLMs answer structured RoB 2
   signaling questions. Deterministic judges convert those answers into D1-D5
   and overall judgments.
4. **Outputs must be auditable.** Reports are accompanied by JSON diagnostics,
   source provenance, retrieval grades, evidence packets, LLM traces, and
   timing traces.

## End-To-End Flow

The compiled LangGraph workflow lives in `rob2_pipeline/graph.py`.

```text
pdf_ingest
  -> rct_screener
  -> preliminary_info
  -> outcome_resolver
  -> trial_facts
  -> rag_retrieval
  -> evidence_packet_builder
  -> D1-D5 signaling-question nodes
  -> deterministic domain judges
  -> quote_verifier
  -> overall_judge
  -> report_formatter
```

The RCT screener can stop the graph early. Otherwise, the run proceeds through
ingestion, evidence selection, signaling-question answering, deterministic
judgment, verification, and report formatting.

`rob2_pipeline/pipeline.py` owns the public `run_assessment()` API and writes
the Markdown report, data JSON, and trace JSON after graph execution. Graph
nodes are wrapped centrally in `rob2_pipeline/graph.py` so every node execution
records a timing span in the active trace.

## Major Subsystems

### Entry Points

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `main.py` | CLI for one PDF or a directory of PDFs |
| `benchmark.py` | CLI for benchmark runs |
| `rob2_pipeline/pipeline.py` | `run_assessment()` API and output writing |
| `rob2_pipeline/benchmark.py` | Benchmark orchestration, comparisons, and summaries |

### Ingestion

Primary paper ingestion is strict because the assessment cannot proceed without
the main article. Supplement ingestion is best-effort unless benchmark
`supplement_policy="required"` is used.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `rob2_pipeline/ingestion/docling_extract.py` | Docling conversion, OCR retry, chunk creation |
| `rob2_pipeline/ingestion/document_repr.py` | Prompt-facing document block representation |
| `rob2_pipeline/ingestion/evidence.py` | Primary-paper structured evidence extraction |
| `rob2_pipeline/ingestion/supplements.py` | Supplement classification, windowed parsing, provenance |
| `rob2_pipeline/ingestion/settings.py` | Ingestion constants and environment controls |
| `rob2_pipeline/pdf_ingestion.py` | Compatibility facade for ingestion helpers |

`pdf_ingest` produces primary-paper text, primary evidence, Docling chunks, and
optional supplement chunks. Supplement chunks are added to retrieval with
explicit metadata; supplement text is not appended to `full_text`.

### Trial Metadata And Registry Enrichment

`preliminary_info` extracts trial metadata such as intervention, comparator,
outcome, and registration number. When an NCT number is available,
`registration_api.py` fetches ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 data.

Registry fields populate state keys such as:

- `registered_endpoint`
- `registered_secondary_endpoints`
- `registered_analysis`
- `ctgov_outcomes`
- `ctgov_design`
- `ctgov_description`
- `ctgov_flow`

ClinicalTrials.gov evidence enters later evidence packets as a structured
source with `source_kind="ctgov"` and `document_role="registry"`.

### Retrieval

Retrieval is per study, not global. Each run builds a FAISS index from that
study's primary and supplement chunks.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `rob2_pipeline/rag.py` | Embeddings, FAISS indexes, adaptive retrieval, grading |
| `rob2_pipeline/rag_queries.py` | Domain and signaling-question query sets |
| `rob2_pipeline/nodes/rag_retrieval.py` | Graph node that emits RAG context and metadata |

The retrieval node runs domain-specific query sets, deduplicates results, keeps
chunks within a token budget, and writes both prompt-facing text
(`rag_contexts`) and JSON-facing metadata (`rag_chunk_metadata`, emitted as
`rag_sources`).

If vector retrieval fails, downstream nodes still receive deterministic
fallback sections extracted from the primary paper.

### Evidence Packets

Evidence packets are the main protection against context overload. They combine
RAG chunks, ClinicalTrials.gov fields, and primary-paper fallback sections into
signaling-question-specific inputs.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `rob2_pipeline/nodes/evidence_contracts.py` | Required evidence for each signaling question |
| `rob2_pipeline/nodes/evidence_source_selection.py` | Candidate source creation and ranking |
| `rob2_pipeline/nodes/evidence_packet_grading.py` | Missing-evidence and quality flags |
| `rob2_pipeline/nodes/evidence_packets.py` | Packet construction and prompt rendering |

Contracts define what each signaling question needs: required labels, matching
terms, fallback sections, denominator requirements, outcome-binding
requirements, and prespecification requirements.

Source ranking is domain-aware. For example, D5 prefers protocol, SAP, and
registry sources; D3 gives weight to appendix and SAP missing-data evidence;
D4 values outcome-definition and adjudication sources.

### LLM Calls

All graph LLM calls go through `call_node_llm()` in
`rob2_pipeline/nodes/common.py`. That layer handles provider selection, prompt
caching, XML parsing and repair, trace logging, and error normalization.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `rob2_pipeline/prompts.py` | Prompt templates |
| `rob2_pipeline/methodology/` | RoB 2 rule cards rendered into prompts |
| `rob2_pipeline/providers/` | OpenRouter, Anthropic, and OpenAI adapters |
| `rob2_pipeline/cache.py` | Optional prompt cache |
| `rob2_pipeline/trace.py` | LLM input/output records and graph-node timing spans |
| `rob2_pipeline/xml_parser.py` | XML extraction and repair helpers |

Avoid direct provider SDK calls inside graph nodes. Keeping calls behind the
provider abstraction makes traces, caching, retries, and tests consistent.

### Timing Instrumentation

The active trace records two timing layers:

| Layer | Trace field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph node spans | `node_spans` | Wall-clock duration, status, timestamps, and error text for each LangGraph node |
| LLM calls | `llm_calls` | Provider-facing latency, cache hits, token counts, repairs, parse errors, and model metadata |

Node spans are produced by the central graph wrapper, not by individual node
implementations. This keeps instrumentation additive as the graph evolves and
ensures exceptions still close spans before the original error is re-raised.

LLM latency and node duration are intentionally separate. A node span includes
all work inside the node, including local parsing, retrieval, Docling work, and
any nested LLM calls. Benchmark summaries use these fields to estimate non-LLM
time as `max(total_wall_ms - llm_total_ms, 0)`.

### Judging, Verification, And Reporting

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `rob2_pipeline/judges/` | Deterministic D1-D5 and overall judgment logic |
| `rob2_pipeline/nodes/verification.py` | Quote support and packet quality verification |
| `rob2_pipeline/nodes/reporter.py` | Markdown report payload |

The domain judges consume parsed signaling-question answers, not raw free-form
model text. The quote verifier adds audit flags and suggested actions when
evidence support looks weak or packet quality is low.

## State Model

State is defined in `rob2_pipeline/state.py` and initialized in
`rob2_pipeline/state_factory.py`.

Important state groups:

| Group | Representative keys |
| --- | --- |
| Inputs | `pdf_path`, `supplementary_paths` |
| Primary ingestion | `full_text`, `evidence`, `docling_doc`, `docling_chunks` |
| Source inventory | `source_documents`, `supplement_warnings` |
| Trial metadata | `intervention`, `comparator`, `outcome`, `registration_number` |
| Registry enrichment | `registered_endpoint`, `ctgov_outcomes`, `ctgov_design`, `ctgov_flow` |
| Retrieval | `rag_contexts`, `rag_chunk_metadata`, `retrieval_grades` |
| Packets | `evidence_packets`, `evidence_facts`, `packet_grades` |
| Judgments | `sq_answers`, `domain_judgments`, `overall_judgment` |
| Quality | `evidence_validation_flags`, `verification_actions`, `human_review_priority` |
| Diagnostics | `errors`, `llm_call_log`, `verifier_trace` |

Several graph nodes run in parallel, so reducers in `state.py` merge node
outputs safely. Dict-like fields merge by key; logs concatenate.

## Source Provenance

Every retrieved or packetized source should be traceable. Source metadata
commonly includes:

- `document_id`
- `document_name`
- `document_role`
- `source_kind`
- `source_path`
- `section`
- `page_numbers`
- `score`

Common `document_role` values are `primary`, `protocol`, `sap`, `appendix`,
`disclosure`, `data_sharing`, `unknown_supplement`, and `registry`.

Common `source_kind` values are `rag_chunk`, `section_text`, and `ctgov`.

Only real `rag_chunk` sources require page numbers. Structured fallbacks such
as `ctgov` and `section_text` are exempt from missing-page validation.

## Supplement Ingestion

Supplement parsing lives in `rob2_pipeline/ingestion/supplements.py`.

Key behavior:

- Supplements are optional by default.
- Supplements never replace `full_text` or primary-paper `evidence`.
- Filename heuristics classify roles such as `protocol`, `sap`, `appendix`,
  `disclosure`, and `data_sharing`.
- Long supplements are parsed in page windows.
- Failed windows are recorded and skipped; later windows continue.
- Empty windows do not stop scanning.
- Usable supplement chunks join the same per-study RAG index as primary chunks.

Runtime controls:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ROB2_SUPPLEMENT_PAGE_WINDOW` | `20` | Number of pages parsed per supplement window |
| `ROB2_SUPPLEMENT_MAX_SCAN_PAGES` | `1000` | Defensive scan limit for very long supplements |
| `ROB2_SUPPLEMENT_MAX_PAGES` | unset | Legacy alias for max scan pages |

`source_documents` records one status per requested source:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `parsed` | Clean parse |
| `partial` | One or more windows failed; inspect warnings and retrieved sources for usable chunks |
| `failed` | No usable content could be extracted |
| `missing` | Requested file did not exist |

Benchmark `required` mode accepts `parsed` and `partial` as present source
documents, but `partial` still requires review of warnings and retrieved
sources. It fails missing, failed, or not-ingested requested supplements.

## Benchmark Architecture

Benchmark execution is implemented in `rob2_pipeline/benchmark.py`; the
top-level `benchmark.py` file handles CLI parsing.

Reference CSVs live in:

```text
data/references/overall_survival.csv
data/references/progression_free_survival.csv
data/references/adverse_events.csv
```

Benchmark inputs are selected with:

```text
--outcome-map TRIAL:OUTCOME[:COHORT]
```

Primary PDFs resolve from `inputs/benchmark/<TRIAL>.pdf`. When
`--use-supplements` is enabled, supplements resolve from
`inputs/benchmark/supplement/<TRIAL>/*.pdf` unless another supplement directory
is supplied.

Benchmark results include the reference row, pipeline judgments, agreement
comparisons, supplement counts, errors, aggregate confusion matrices, and
timing summaries.

Each benchmark result gets a `timing` object when an assessment is attempted or
fails before execution in a non-skipped path. It includes:

- total wall-clock runtime for the assessment attempt
- whether the assessment trace was available
- total graph-node duration
- total LLM latency, LLM call count, cache hits, repairs, and parse errors
- estimated non-LLM time
- slowest nodes
- LLM latency grouped by node

`benchmark_report.md` renders a `Timing Summary` section with aggregate
wall-clock timing, slowest runs, and node timing totals. Raw per-node span
payloads remain in the per-assessment trace JSON rather than the public
benchmark summary JSON.

## Debugging Guide

Useful commands:

```bash
uv run python main.py inputs/example.pdf --debug
uv run python benchmark.py --outcome-map CHAARTED:OS --dry-run
uv run python -m pytest -q
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_supplements.py -q
```

For a wrong judgment, inspect in this order:

1. `domain_judgments` and `domain_rationales`
2. relevant `sq_answers`
3. relevant `evidence_packets`
4. domain `rag_sources`
5. `retrieval_grades` and `packet_grades`
6. `evidence_validation_flags` and `verification_actions`

For ingestion problems, inspect:

1. `evidence.warnings`
2. `source_documents`
3. `supplement_warnings`
4. the LLM trace for extraction failures
5. `node_spans` for slow or failed ingestion nodes

Common failure modes:

| Problem | First check |
| --- | --- |
| XML parse failure | Trace JSON and `xml_parser.py` |
| RCT stops early | `is_rct`, `rct_screen_evidence`, `errors` |
| Missing randomization or masking evidence | D1/D2 packets and RAG sources |
| Missing-data uncertainty | D3 packets, denominator flags, appendix/SAP sources |
| Selective-reporting uncertainty | D5 packets, CT.gov fields, protocol/SAP sources |
| Supplement parse issue | `source_documents`, `supplement_warnings` |
| `std::bad_alloc` from Docling | Supplement window warnings; reduce page-window size |
| Empty RAG output | embedding availability and primary evidence warnings |
| Slow benchmark run | `benchmark_report.md` Timing Summary, per-result `timing`, and trace `node_spans` |

## Extension Guide

### Add Or Change A Signaling Question

1. Update the relevant RoB 2 methodology card under `rob2_pipeline/methodology/`.
2. Update prompt templates in `rob2_pipeline/prompts.py`.
3. Add or adjust query text in `rob2_pipeline/rag_queries.py`.
4. Update the evidence contract in `nodes/evidence_contracts.py`.
5. Update packet selection or grading if the evidence requirements changed.
6. Update the relevant graph node and deterministic judge.
7. Add tests for parsing, packets, and judge behavior.

### Add A New Evidence Source

Prefer adding the source as an evidence-packet candidate with explicit
`source_kind`, `document_role`, and provenance metadata. Avoid blending external
source text into primary-paper evidence unless it was extracted from the primary
publication itself.

### Add A New LLM Node

Use `call_node_llm()` from `nodes/common.py`. This keeps provider calls,
caching, XML parsing, trace logging, and error handling consistent across the
graph.

## Production Notes

- Human review remains required.
- Prompt cache is opt-in with `ROB2_USE_CACHE=1`.
- Rate limiting is lock-protected for concurrent graph fan-out.
- Timing instrumentation is always on and additive; it does not alter pipeline
  decisions or benchmark accuracy calculations.
- ClinicalTrials.gov evidence is supporting evidence; it may disagree with
  protocols or publications.
- Supplement ingestion is intentionally tolerant in normal runs and stricter in
  benchmark `required` mode.
- The JSON artifacts are as important as the Markdown report for auditing.
