# auto-rob2

`auto-rob2` produces automated Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2)
assessments for randomized controlled trial reports.

The pipeline ingests a primary study PDF, optionally adds supplementary PDFs
such as protocols or appendices, enriches the record with ClinicalTrials.gov
data when available, retrieves targeted evidence, asks LLMs to answer RoB 2
signaling questions, and then applies deterministic Python judges for the final
D1-D5 and overall judgments.

The output is a reviewer-facing draft plus detailed JSON diagnostics. It is
intended to support human review, not replace it.

## Quick Start

Requires Python `>=3.13`. `uv sync` will create or use a compatible environment
when one is available.

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Create a `.env` file with at least one provider key:

```text
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Optional alternatives:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Run one assessment:

```bash
uv run python main.py inputs/example.pdf --output-dir outputs
```

Run one assessment for a specific outcome:

```bash
uv run python main.py inputs/example.pdf \
  --outcome "Overall Survival" \
  --effect ITT \
  --output-dir outputs
```

Run with supplements discovered from a per-study supplement folder:

```bash
uv run python main.py inputs/benchmark/CHAARTED.pdf \
  --outcome "Overall Survival" \
  --supplement-dir inputs/benchmark/supplement \
  --output-dir outputs
```

Run a benchmark dry run to validate inputs without LLM calls:

```bash
uv run python benchmark.py \
  --outcome-map CHAARTED:OS ARCHES:PFS \
  --dry-run
```

## What The Pipeline Uses

- Docling for PDF extraction and document chunking.
- LangGraph for the workflow.
- LangChain FAISS plus BGE-small embeddings for per-study retrieval.
- ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 for registry/design/outcome enrichment.
- LLMs for RCT screening, metadata extraction, and signaling-question answers.
- Deterministic Python judges for final domain and overall RoB 2 labels.

The embedding model is `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`. The first run may download
model files. If your environment requires Hugging Face authentication, run:

```bash
hf auth login
```

or set `HF_TOKEN`.

## Inputs

Primary PDFs can be passed directly to `main.py`, or placed under
`inputs/benchmark/` for benchmark runs. Local inputs and outputs are ignored by
git.

Recommended benchmark layout:

```text
inputs/benchmark/
  CHAARTED.pdf
  ARCHES.pdf
  supplement/
    CHAARTED/
      protocol.pdf
      appendix.pdf
    ARCHES/
      supplementary_appendix.pdf
```

Supplement discovery maps the primary PDF stem to a folder under the supplement
directory. For example, `inputs/benchmark/CHAARTED.pdf` uses files from
`inputs/benchmark/supplement/CHAARTED/`.

For single-PDF runs, you can also pass explicit supplement files:

```bash
uv run python main.py inputs/benchmark/CHAARTED.pdf \
  --outcome "Overall Survival" \
  --supplement inputs/benchmark/supplement/CHAARTED/protocol.pdf \
  --supplement inputs/benchmark/supplement/CHAARTED/appendix.pdf
```

`--supplement` is only valid for single-PDF input. For directories, use
`--supplement-dir` so supplements cannot be accidentally applied to the wrong
study.

## Outputs

Each completed assessment writes:

```text
outputs/<pdf_basename>_rob2_report.md
outputs/<pdf_basename>_rob2_data.json
outputs/<pdf_basename>_trace.json
```

- The Markdown report is the human-readable draft RoB 2 assessment.
- The data JSON is the main audit artifact.
- The trace JSON captures LLM inputs and outputs for debugging.

Useful JSON fields:

| Field                                  | What it tells you                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain_judgments`, `overall_judgment` | Final deterministic RoB 2 labels                     |
| `sq_answers`                           | Parsed LLM signaling-question answers                |
| `evidence`                             | Structured evidence extracted from the primary paper |
| `source_documents`                     | Primary and supplement parse inventory               |
| `supplement_warnings`                  | Non-fatal supplement ingestion issues                |
| `rag_sources`                          | Retrieved chunks with document/page provenance       |
| `evidence_packets`                     | Evidence selected for each signaling question        |
| `retrieval_grades`, `packet_grades`    | Retrieval and packet quality diagnostics             |
| `evidence_validation_flags`            | Quote-support and quality flags                      |
| `verification_actions`                 | Suggested retry or review actions                    |

If the paper is screened as non-RCT, the graph stops early. JSON is still
written, but report and judgment fields may be absent.

## Benchmarking

Benchmarks compare pipeline judgments against reference RoB 2 CSVs in
`data/references/`.

Run selected trial/outcome pairs:

```bash
uv run python benchmark.py \
  --outcome-map CHAARTED:OS ARCHES:PFS PEACE-1:AE
```

Outcome codes:

| Code  | Outcome                   |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| `OS`  | Overall Survival          |
| `PFS` | Progression-Free Survival |
| `AE`  | Adverse Events            |

Outcome-map entries may include a cohort label:

```bash
uv run python benchmark.py \
  --outcome-map CHAARTED:OS:calibration ARCHES:PFS:validation
```

Run with benchmark supplements:

```bash
uv run python benchmark.py \
  --outcome-map CHAARTED:OS CHAARTED:PFS \
  --use-supplements \
  --supplement-dir inputs/benchmark/supplement \
  --output-dir outputs/benchmark/chaarted_supplement
```

Supplement policies:

| Policy     | Behavior                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`     | Use supplements when found; continue on supplement warnings       |
| `required` | Treat missing or failed requested supplements as benchmark errors |
| `none`     | Ignore supplements                                                |

Benchmark outputs:

```text
<output-dir>/benchmark_report.md
<output-dir>/benchmark_results.json
<output-dir>/<TRIAL>_<OUTCOME_CODE>/...
```

## Supplement Handling

Supplements are supporting evidence sources. They are not concatenated into the
primary paper text and do not replace the primary publication.

At ingestion time, the pipeline:

1. Parses the primary PDF normally.
2. Classifies supplement files from their filenames when possible.
3. Parses supplements in bounded page windows.
4. Skips failed supplement windows and records warnings.
5. Adds usable supplement chunks to RAG with document provenance.
6. Surfaces supplement source name, role, page, and path in JSON diagnostics.

Supplement statuses in `source_documents`:

| Status    | Meaning                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parsed`  | All attempted supplement windows parsed cleanly                                    |
| `partial` | One or more windows failed; check warnings and retrieved sources for usable chunks |
| `failed`  | No usable content could be extracted                                               |
| `missing` | The requested supplement file did not exist                                        |

Windowed parsing avoids losing an entire long protocol or appendix because one
page triggers a native Docling memory error such as `std::bad_alloc`.

Provider and model settings are read when modules are imported, so export them
before invoking the CLI.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                     | First places to inspect                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LLM XML parse failure       | Trace JSON and `rob2_pipeline/xml_parser.py`                     |
| Early non-RCT stop          | `is_rct`, `rct_screen_evidence`, `errors`                        |
| Missing evidence            | `evidence`, `rag_sources`, `evidence_packets`                    |
| Weak D3/D5 support          | `packet_grades`, `verification_actions`, supplement sources      |
| Supplement parse errors     | `source_documents`, `supplement_warnings`                        |
| ClinicalTrials.gov mismatch | Registered endpoint fields and CT.gov-derived `evidence_packets` |
| Empty RAG output            | embedding model availability and `evidence.warnings`             |

For large supplements with repeated skipped windows, reduce
`ROB2_SUPPLEMENT_PAGE_WINDOW`. To scan deeper into very long supplements,
increase `ROB2_SUPPLEMENT_MAX_SCAN_PAGES`.
