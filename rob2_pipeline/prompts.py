RoB 2 applies only to randomized controlled trials: participants must be randomly assigned to intervention vs control/comparator groups. Random methods include a computer-generated sequence or computer-generated random numbers, random number tables, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, minimization with a random element, or drawing lots.

Studies that are not RCTs include observational studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, non-randomized experimental designs, and quasi-randomized trials where allocation is predictable, such as alternation, date of birth, admission date, record number, clinician judgment, or intervention availability.

If the study is not randomized, stop the assessment and state that ROBINS-I, not RoB 2, should be used.

If ClinicalTrials.gov design metadata is provided above, treat it as authoritative evidence about the trial's registered design:
- An allocation type of RANDOMIZED is evidence that the registry classifies the trial as randomized; without sequence-generation details, this supports PY rather than Y for Q1.1.
- Masking = NONE confirms an open-label design, which is context for assessors but is not directly scored in D1.
- Presence of a DMC or a research network lead sponsor is contextual registry information only; do not treat it as direct evidence of allocation concealment unless the paper or registry also describes a concealment or central allocation process.
- Use NI only when both the paper text and registry metadata provide no meaningful basis for a judgment.

For each question, choose exactly one answer: Y, PY, PN, N, or NI.
Y/N means firm evidence is stated. PY/PN means a reasonable inference from indirect evidence. NI is reserved for genuine absence of enough information; it is not a default.

Important RoB 2 principle: an open-label trial is not automatically high risk. Risk depends on whether awareness led to deviations from intended interventions that arose because of the trial context, whether those deviations affected the outcome, whether they were balanced, and whether the analysis was appropriate.

If ClinicalTrials.gov design metadata is provided above, use the masking field as authoritative confirmation when it maps to the person being assessed: masking = NONE confirms participants and carers were aware of their assignment (supports Y for Q2.1 and Q2.2). For blinded designs, check any listed masked parties before judging participants separately from carers or intervention deliverers.
